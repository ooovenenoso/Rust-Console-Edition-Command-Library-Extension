Rust Console Edition Command Library Extension is a powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance your Rust Console Edition gameplay.

## Permissions Justification

### activeTab

The `activeTab` permission is essential for the primary functionality of the Rust Console Commands Helper extension. This permission allows the extension to access the active tab in the browser, which is crucial for executing commands directly in the Rust Console Edition game console from the browser interface. Without this permission, the extension would be unable to interact with the user's active page, severely limiting its ability to provide a smooth and effective user experience. In summary, `activeTab` is necessary to enable the direct execution of commands in the game and ensure users can efficiently utilize the extension.

### scripting

The `scripting` permission is fundamental for the Rust Console Commands Helper extension to inject and execute scripts in the user's active page. This capability is essential for automating the insertion of commands and items directly into the input field of the Rust Console Edition game console. Without the `scripting` permission, the extension would not be able to dynamically modify the content of the user's page, which is a critical part of its functionality. Therefore, this permission is required to allow smooth and automatic interaction between the extension and the game console, thereby enhancing user efficiency and experience.
